Against any expectations RStoolbox is back in the blog after... 8 YEARS?? We'll better late then never.

## Update to Terra and sf
Since the raster and sp package will slowly face their end because of the outdated rgdal, RStoolbox moved on to process
its stuff on those new packages.

## RStoolbox on CRAN
RStoolbox is also back on CRAN and can be installed with the `install.packages()` command. Although, it is highly recommended
to always install the GitHub version of the `dev` or `master` branch to ensure to be always be up to date!
