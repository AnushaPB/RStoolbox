RStoolbox is an R package providing a wide range of tools for your every-day remote sensing processing needs. The available tool-set covers many aspects from data import, pre-processing, data analysis, image classification and graphical display. RStoolbox builds upon the terra package, which makes it suitable for processing large data-sets even on smaller workstations.

For more details have a look at the [functions overview](https://bleutner.github.io/RStoolbox/reference/index.html).
