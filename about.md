### ... the authors 

*Benjamin Leutner*: I'm a remote sensing scientist at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and an environmental scientist by training. My research interests lay in the application of remote sensing in conservation, ecology and biodiversity research.  I am working primarily with airborne hyperspectral imagery and
full-waveform lidar data, yet the odd multispectral scene slips in every now and then as well. 
I firmly believe in the importance of using free and open-source software (free as in freedom), especially in the educational and scientific domain. While R certainly wasn't born, 
for handling large spatial data-sets it has come a very long way and thanks to efforts such as the sp and raster packages it has evolved into a full fledged GIS and only very rarely do I find myself switching to QGIS, GRASS or SAGA instead.

*Ned Horning* is the Director of Applied Biodiversity Informatics at the American Museum of Natural History's Center for Biodiversity and Conservation (CBC). He has over 30 years experience using remote sensing, GIS, and related skills including field mapping and the collection of training and validation data to aid and evaluate remote sensing-based mapping projects. His specialties include mapping and monitoring land cover at local through global scales and developing geospatial data processing and analysis education and outreach materials. Prior to starting his tenure at the CBC in 2002 he worked for nine years at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and spent nine years working as an independent geospatial consultant.

### ... the package

RStoolbox is written mostly in [Hadley style](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/): documentation is managed by [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html), package maintenance, checking and building by [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) and testing by [testthat](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html). The primary building-blocks of RStoolbox certainly are the [terra](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/index.html) and [sf](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) packages, complemented by the impressive modelling framework of the [caret](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html) package..
