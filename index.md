#### The Package
**RStoolbox** is a R package providing a wide range of tools for your every-day remote sensing processing needs. 
The available toolset covers many aspects from data import, pre-processing, data analysis, image classification and graphical display. 
RStoolbox builds upon the raster package, which makes it suitable for processing large data-sets even on smaller workstations. The package is published under GPL3.
   
   
#### Installing RStoolbox
RStoolbox is now available from CRAN and can be installed as usual with

    install.packages("RStoolbox")

To get the latest development version, install RStoolbox directly from the [github repository](http://www.github.com/bleutner/RStoolbox). Apart from R itself, you'll also need to have r-base-dev (Linux) or [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools) (Windows) installed to compile the package.

    library(devtools)
    install_github("bleutner/RStoolbox")
